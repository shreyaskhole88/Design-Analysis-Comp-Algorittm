Compile all programs using g++ <<file.cpp>>.

1) For Floyd's Algorithm:

Run using ./a.out

Output: Adjacency matrix, Distance Matrix(D), print matrix(P) and all pairs shortest path and
	their length.
Using 100 to initialise print matrix.

2) For Dijkstra's Algorithm:

Run using ./a.out

Output: Adjacency matrix and shortest path from source node 0 and their lengths.

3) For Prim's Algorithm:

Run using ./a.out 

Output: Adjacency matrix and shortest edges in MST with their length and weight of minimum spanning tree.

For all programs, infinity is declared as 1000 (weight is not more than 10).
